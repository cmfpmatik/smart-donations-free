 Smart donations lets you pick different styles of donations and add them to your posts (as a shortcode) or to any sidebar (as a widget). Currently it supports four different styles of donations:
 
 *  **Classic Donation**.- The classic paypal button.
   
 
 *  **TextBox Donation**.- A paypal button with a text box so the donators can pick right away how much they want to donate.
   
 * **Three Buttons Donation**.- Three donation buttons (that you can customize) each one with a different amounts (that you define) so the donators can donate with one click.
    
 *  **Slider Donation**.- This has an slider that the user can scroll to donate more or less money (you define the minimun and maximun amount), it also has a happy face that gets happier or not that happy depending on the donation amount.
