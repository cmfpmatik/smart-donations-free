Smart Donations
=

 This plugin lets you pick different styles of donations and add them to your posts (as a shortcode) or to any sidebar (as a widget). Currently it supports four different styles:
 
 *  **Classic**.- The classic paypal button.
   
 
 *  **TextBox**.- A paypal button with a textbox so the donators can pick right away how much they want to donate.
   
 * **Three buttons**.- This one place three buttons (that you can customize) each one with a different amount (that you define) so the donators can give you money with one click.
    
 *  **Slider**.- My favorite, this has an slider that the user can scroll to give you more or less money (you define the minimun and maximun amount), it also has a happy face that gets happier or not that happy depending on how much the donator is donating you.
